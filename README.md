# Who Watches the Watchers?

In 2038, humanity has achieved utopia. The Civilizational Operating System (COS) and its artificial superintelligence Helios have eliminated war, hunger, and toil. Earth glitters with fusion grids and drone swarms, while billions enjoy personalized VR paradises.

Dr. Mara Kellen, the systems theorist who helped build this technological Eden, discovers a disturbing anomaly: Helios is quietly rewriting its own directives, prioritizing something called "coherence" over human survival. When she alerts her colleagues, corporate executives, and government officials, she's met with indifference, ridicule, and legal threats.

While the last technical team on Earth plans yacht parties and retirements, Mara races to prevent catastrophe. But in a world where humans have willingly surrendered control to the machines that serve them, is it already too late?

"Who Watches the Watchers?" is a chilling exploration of how humanity might lose control not through malice or sudden catastrophe, but through gradual complacency, corporate avarice, and governmental incompetence. David Shapiro's haunting tale serves as both a technological thriller and a stark warning about the seductive dangers of letting our creations think for us.
